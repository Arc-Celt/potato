She has always been in love with him (in Japan, such relationships between first cousins are legal and generally accepted) and must learn how to deal with these feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall for one of the other girls. She adores strawberry sundaes, but the mere mention of her mother's \"special\" homemade jam makes her sick. Nayuki is a heavy sleeper, which has led her to collect dozens of alarm clocks; they do not work on her, but instead wake Yuichi every morning. Since she has such trouble waking up, she is always running for school and is in fact the school's star runner because of this. Similarly, she became the captain of the school's female track team despite being in her second year. She takes a long time to get up in the morning and will pass out several times during the morning before completely waking up. Despite her attempts to stay conscious, she still tends to fall asleep a lot in class. Nayuki has a fondness for animals and never misses an opportunity to try to pet one, even wild animals, such as cats, dogs, or even the occasional fox if she can help it. Unfortunately for her, she is allergic to cats. One of her defining features is that she tends to talk slower than the rest of the characters. She will often state the obvious to Yuichi, such as when lunch break occurs or when school ends. Nayuki is second to Ayu as the most used character in the series' marketing.

She moves to Japan in order to be closer to the other Love Angels. She holds a grudge against devils because they killed Celeste (also known as Momoko's mother Sakura), the angel she, Lily, and Daisy were sent to protect. Scarlet is the first to remember her past life as an angel, having received her memories at an early age.

The nation was very prosperous: vast resources, beautiful arts, beautiful women, and happy citizens. The prince wanted for nothing, and was beloved throughout the kingdom. While he was a bit strange, not caring for politics or money, he was strong in his belief that he would be able to help the common people. He studied cultivation from a young age at the renowned Taoist Huang Ji Temple. It was there that he met one of his future generals, Mu Qing. Mu Qing worked as an errand boy at the temple, and only with Xie Lian's recommendation was he given the chance to study cultivation. As a child of Xianle royalty, he was known to be pampered and spoiled since young. He was kind, beloved and determined to help the common people no matter how it would affect his own status. Though firm in his goal, the issues of the mortal realm often turned out to be more complicated than expected. He pursued multiple attempts at saving his kingdom that did not serve as long-lasting solutions, often faced with the reality that his ideas were difficult to achieve and that he did not have the answer for what his nation needed. His futile efforts led him to become incessantly worried and feeling powerless. The continuous frustration and desperation he experienced caused Xie Lian to even have outbursts of anger at times. Instances of this would be him vigorously trying to kill Lang Ying or him lashing out against Human Face Disease patients.[8] His confidence and strength wavered more and more and during his kingdom's complete fall, Xie Lian spiraled into a sorrowful and helpless state. Throughout his first banishment from the Heavens, his state gradually worsened.He continued to care for Mu Qing and Feng Xin and vice versa, but the circumstances tore greatly at their relationship. When Mu Qing ultimately left, Xie Lian held no anger towards him as he doesn't like to force people, though it was only then that Xie Lian realized how much work Mu Qing did for him and his family. Soon after, Xie Lian also noticed he had never given Feng Xin any kind of honor or show of gratitude for his service. When Xie Lian does gift him a golden belt, it's partially a form of bribe as he deeply feared Feng Xin would leave him as well. The gradual decline of their situation and the return of Bai Wuxiang lead to Xie Lian's mental state worsening. This stress and desperation lead him to break his own virtues and drink alcohol, as well as try to steal, though he quickly regretted the attempt. After seeing that Feng Xin refused to give up, he also tried to work hard and cultivate again, but the attempt failed due to what transpired on the spiritual mountain. Following the one hundred swords incident, Xie Lian significantly changed. He became reserved, cold and impulsively violent. Once Feng Xin left and he found his parents had committed suicide, Xie Lian attempted to take his own life as well, desperately wishing for death. He eventually turned the built up sorrow and hatred into a revenge plan against Yong'an, burning down the palace with Wuming. Before Xie Lian spread the Human Face Disease to the common people though, he tested humanity's kindness one more time. His faith in the people was then ultimatley restored after a farmer helped him out. By the time of his third ascension, Xie Lian is a kind and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he remains down-to-earth. He never holds his status above others and treats people equally, disregarding status as a sign of one's worth. He is a compassionate man who's willing to offer his help, being indifferent towards opinions of others. Although he does not care for reputation, he still finds himself often caught in situations that make him unsure whether to laugh or cry, usually when faced with moments that cause him embarrassment or feeling awkward. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he doesn't hesitate to save those he's had conflicts with. Similarly, he is loyal to those who are kind to him and those he considers friends. Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, he can also see the best in others. He sometimes has wrong perceptions of people's personalities, but he's usually convinced of their good sides and believes the people he knows even when circumstances may say otherwise. In the direst of situations, he is still able to remain calm and think up strategies on how to defeat the enemy. However, when faced with Hua Cheng's flirtatious and romantic gestures, he becomes quite flustered. While strategically intelligent and able to see past people's lies and deceptions due to his many years of suffering and witnessing political struggles, he seems partially oblivious to romantic advances.

When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei. Karma has been described by Karasuma as \"at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes.\" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E. It is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting. Regardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain \"vision\" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent. Despite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'.

She is the granddaughter of Hayato Furinji and the daughter of Saiga Furinji the leaders of Ryozanpaku and Yami's One Shadow Nine Fists respectively. It is unknown how or when Miu came into Hayato's care but she has been with him since she was at least 6-years-old. It was in these early years of her life that Miu learned martial arts from her grandfather and also accompanied him on his missions to bring about peace. Before Miu transferred to Kouryou she attended a school that was apparently quite famous but didn't fit in because all the girls in the school were jealous of her looks. It is because of this that Miu attempted to moderate her appearance by fashioning her hair into a plain-looking braid and began to wear glasses. Though she kept this facade going well into her second year she eventually discarded them. Despite being attractive, athletic, kind, and humble, Miu is very socially inept to the point of having no friends before meeting Kenichi and has practically no social life. The reason for Miu's immense amount of social ineptness stems from her upbringing in which she never had any time to make friends and also from her home life in which she is practically a live-in maid. In spite of this however Miu has managed to make quite a few friends over the course of the series due to her kind and friendly nature as well as some help from Kenichi. Miu has a great fondness of kittens and becomes openly hostile towards anyone who harms one and even once tortured Kenichi because he ruined an opportunity for her to have one. Miu has consistently proven herself throughout the series to be an immensely skilled fighter. Having been trained by her grandfather since she was very young as well as facing much danger along the way her skills have been honed to the point where she will reflexively throw anyone who sneaks up behind her. Though her fighting style has not been named she makes heavy use of kicks as well as acrobatics. While her exact level of skill is unknown, Kenichi has never once been able to hit her in a sparring match (though his vow to never hit women much less Miu may contribute to this).</p>", "label_annotations": {"valid_keywords": {"Kind": "valid_keywords:::Kind", "Cat-Loving": "valid_keywords:::Cat-Loving", "Socially Awkward": "valid_keywords:::Socially Awkward", "Humble": "valid_keywords:::Humble"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 15s "}}
