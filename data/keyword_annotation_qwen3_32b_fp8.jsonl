{"id": "akabane__karma_71933.json", "text": "<h1>Karma Akabane(赤羽 業)</h1><p>Age: 14-15 Birthday: December 25 Height: 175 cm Blood type: AB Abilities: assassination, academics Favorite subject: mathematics Least favorite subject: Japanese Favorite food: his own cooking Hobby: provocation, mischief and harassment Class seat number: 1 Karma is well-known throughout the school for his violent behavior and troublesome attitude. When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei. Karma has been described by Karasuma as \"at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes.\" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E. It is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting. Regardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain \"vision\" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent. Despite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'. He's also shown to be hardworking when he wants to by studying diligently after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games.

{"id": "xie__lian_174773.json", "text": "<h1>Lian Xie(谢 怜)</h1><p>Birthday: July 15 Xie Lian was born to the Emperor and Empress of the nation of Xian Le. The nation was very prosperous: vast resources, beautiful arts, beautiful women, and happy citizens. The prince wanted for nothing, and was beloved throughout the kingdom. While he was a bit strange, not caring for politics or money, he was strong in his belief that he would be able to help the common people. He studied cultivation from a young age at the renowned Taoist Huang Ji Temple. It was there that he met one of his future generals, Mu Qing. Mu Qing worked as an errand boy at the temple, and only with Xie Lian's recommendation was he given the chance to study cultivation. As a child of Xianle royalty, he was known to be pampered and spoiled since young. He was kind, beloved and determined to help the common people no matter how it would affect his own status. Though firm in his goal, the issues of the mortal realm often turned out to be more complicated than expected. He pursued multiple attempts at saving his kingdom that did not serve as long-lasting solutions, often faced with the reality that his ideas were difficult to achieve and that he did not have the answer for what his nation needed. His futile efforts led him to become incessantly worried and feeling powerless. The continuous frustration and desperation he experienced caused Xie Lian to even have outbursts of anger at times. Instances of this would be him vigorously trying to kill Lang Ying or him lashing out against Human Face Disease patients.[8] His confidence and strength wavered more and more and during his kingdom's complete fall, Xie Lian spiraled into a sorrowful and helpless state. Throughout his first banishment from the Heavens, his state gradually worsened.He continued to care for Mu Qing and Feng Xin and vice versa, but the circumstances tore greatly at their relationship. When Mu Qing ultimately left, Xie Lian held no anger towards him as he doesn't like to force people, though it was only then that Xie Lian realized how much work Mu Qing did for him and his family. Soon after, Xie Lian also noticed he had never given Feng Xin any kind of honor or show of gratitude for his service. When Xie Lian does gift him a golden belt, it's partially a form of bribe as he deeply feared Feng Xin would leave him as well. The gradual decline of their situation and the return of Bai Wuxiang lead to Xie Lian's mental state worsening. This stress and desperation lead him to break his own virtues and drink alcohol, as well as try to steal, though he quickly regretted the attempt. After seeing that Feng Xin refused to give up, he also tried to work hard and cultivate again, but the attempt failed due to what transpired on the spiritual mountain. Following the one hundred swords incident, Xie Lian significantly changed. He became reserved, cold and impulsively violent. Once Feng Xin left and he found his parents had committed suicide, Xie Lian attempted to take his own life as well, desperately wishing for death. He eventually turned the built up sorrow and hatred into a revenge plan against Yong'an, burning down the palace with Wuming. Before Xie Lian spread the Human Face Disease to the common people though, he tested humanity's kindness one more time. His faith in the people was then ultimatley restored after a farmer helped him out. By the time of his third ascension, Xie Lian is a kind and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he remains down-to-earth. He never holds his status above others and treats people equally, disregarding status as a sign of one's worth. He is a compassionate man who's willing to offer his help, being indifferent towards opinions of others. Although he does not care for reputation, he still finds himself often caught in situations that make him unsure whether to laugh or cry, usually when faced with moments that cause him embarrassment or feeling awkward. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he doesn't hesitate to save those he's had conflicts with. Similarly, he is loyal to those who are kind to him and those he considers friends. Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, he can also see the best in others. He sometimes has wrong perceptions of people's personalities, but he's usually convinced of their good sides and believes the people he knows even when circumstances may say otherwise. In the direst of situations, he is still able to remain calm and think up strategies on how to defeat the enemy. However, when faced with Hua Cheng's flirtatious and romantic gestures, he becomes quite flustered. While strategically intelligent and able to see past people's lies and deceptions due to his many years of suffering and witnessing political struggles, he seems partially oblivious to romantic advances.

She is the granddaughter of Hayato Furinji and the daughter of Saiga Furinji the leaders of Ryozanpaku and Yami's One Shadow Nine Fists respectively. It is unknown how or when Miu came into Hayato's care but she has been with him since she was at least 6-years-old. It was in these early years of her life that Miu learned martial arts from her grandfather and also accompanied him on his missions to bring about peace. Before Miu transferred to Kouryou she attended a school that was apparently quite famous but didn't fit in because all the girls in the school were jealous of her looks. It is because of this that Miu attempted to moderate her appearance by fashioning her hair into a plain-looking braid and began to wear glasses. Though she kept this facade going well into her second year she eventually discarded them. Despite being attractive, athletic, kind, and humble, Miu is very socially inept to the point of having no friends before meeting Kenichi and has practically no social life. The reason for Miu's immense amount of social ineptness stems from her upbringing in which she never had any time to make friends and also from her home life in which she is practically a live-in maid. In spite of this however Miu has managed to make quite a few friends over the course of the series due to her kind and friendly nature as well as some help from Kenichi. Miu has a great fondness of kittens and becomes openly hostile towards anyone who harms one and even once tortured Kenichi because he ruined an opportunity for her to have one. Miu has consistently proven herself throughout the series to be an immensely skilled fighter.

His build is fairly lean, but on a few occasions the other members of the Student Council note his muscles are quite solid. He helps the members of the council in doing heavy work, considering that he's the only guy. His eyes are a light brown color; His hair is a deep brown shade with two bangs on the side of his head that extend downwards, with smaller bangs that stick out of the longer two bangs. Additionally, he has short bangs that stretch down to his forehead. Rare is the day you see him in anything other than his school attire, but when it happens, Tsuda is never really in a definitive or personalized outfit. His clothes are fairly randomized, so it's obvious that he doesn't have any particular style. According to Ranko Hata, Takatoshi is considered quite good looking and quite popular with the female students due to his diligent and kind personality by the female population and is popular among them. It's only the false belief that he is dating Shino that prevents them from approach. Takatoshi is a fairly complacent person, but not to the extent where his grades are bad. He likes to slack off and laze around as much as the next person, but he knows when to get serious and sacrifice time to do his work, especially work for the Student Council, which he seems to be doing most of the time. Despite his laziness, Takatoshi is a smart person. While nowhere near as academically brilliant as his fellow members of the Student Council, he performs well in most subjects when necessary. He especially excels at writing, as he once wrote a short story that brought virtually everyone who read it to tears. This literary talent is often on display whenever the Student Council (or pretty much anyone around him) starts making indecent jokes, or even jokes or remarks in general. In such cases, Takatoshi has a knack for being able to respond with witty wisecracks and retorts with ease. Thanks to frequently being around Shino and Aria, this skill has been exercised to the point where it is simply instinctive. He also helps his sister a lot at home by doing things she requested him to do and finishing it all off brilliantly. He also once helped her study for the entrance exam. Takatoshi is also unfortunately quite dense when it comes to relationships, as he seems genuinely oblivious to the fact at least three girls are romantically interested in him. This aspect of him is well-known enough that Uomi, a girl from a completely different school, nicknamed him 'Flag-Crusher' .

Henny first appeared watching Ash and his friends from behind a rock as they were attacked by Chapman's Chesnaught. Later, when the group reached Chapman Research Lab, Henny confronted the group, questioning what they were doing there. After learning from Clemont that they had come to learn more about the robot they saw outside, Henny introduced himself and showed the group a video made by Chapman, who explained what happened to the land and his reason for constructing Robon. Henny then explained that even though Chapman passed away, Robon had continued to plant seeds while Chesnaught continued to protect Robon from any sort of harm. Later, when Robon came to the lab to charge itself and Clemont decided to fix the machine which charges Robon, Henny interfered, stating that he didn't want Robon and Chesnaught to continue working on trying to restore the land as their efforts were futile. Clemont explained that Robon wanted to replant the forest, so they should be helping Robon instead of stopping it and claimed that giving up is what will cause the progress of science to come to a stand-still, and that they need to continue on in order for them to make more progress. Everyone agreed that taking on challenges is the only way to progress and this got through to Henny. Moments later, Robon was fully charged, much to Henny's surprise as he thanked Clemont for everything he did. When everyone went outside to help Robon, Henny calmed an angry Chesnaught, explaining that they only wanted to help Robon. Later, when Robon was destroyed in its attempt to save Chesnaught from Team Rocket, a devastated Henny was comforted by Clemont who repeated his statement that the progress of science stops the moment a person gives up. He, along with others, then watched in anticipation, as Clemont tried to fix the robot. After Robon was successfully repaired and managed to break through the rock blocking a spring, an amazed Henny was informed by Clemont that each part of Robon was constructed with lots of love by Chapman. At this, Henny announced that he wanted to become a scientist as well, so that if Robon ever needed fixing again, he would be able to do it.

She despises the people of the Class and doesn't really care for the people of Lux, either. She simply wants to create the best Texhnolyze out there - one that will completely fuse with a human. While in Lux, she treats both Oonishi and Ichise. She uses Ichise as sort of a guinea pig at first, but kind of falls in love with him as time goes on. The phrase 'married to your work' could be used in this situation. Eventually she finishes her research, but when she goes to present it to Kanno, he rejects her and attempts to kill her. He then uses her research to create the Shapes instead of putting it to use the way she wanted it to be used: to create humans who could realize a greater potential. Afterwards, she falls into a downward spiral of self-pity and drinks her life away. Ichise eventually comes back to retrieve her and get her to help heal the men who were wounded in fights against Shapes. She continues to bitch on the way back to Lux that it's pointless to fight against them. She forces Ichise to hold her tight and then tells him that they should run away to Gabe and find a place to live. They run into Oonishi and Shinji who ask her to go to the upper world to warn people about Kanno's plans. She agrees to go and warn the Class. Upon arriving, she realizes that everyone there has already given up on survival and all her work on Texhnolyze as an evolutionary trigger for the human species was in vain. She tried to warn Saginuma about Kanno's plans, but he doesn't seem to care all that much or even consider them a threat. Afterwards, she falls back into her depression and decides to stay behind since she has nothing left to live for. We are led to believe she drowned herself after Ichise left. She returns as a shadow in the final episode and activates the final amount of power left in Ichise's Texhnolyze, which enables him to beat the men who killed Oonishi.
