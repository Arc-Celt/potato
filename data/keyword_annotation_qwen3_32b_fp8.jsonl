{"id": "akabane__karma_71933.json", "text": "<h1>Karma Akabane(赤羽 業)</h1><p>Age: 14-15 Birthday: December 25 Height: 175 cm Blood type: AB Abilities: assassination, academics Favorite subject: mathematics Least favorite subject: Japanese Favorite food: his own cooking Hobby: provocation, mischief and harassment Class seat number: 1 Karma is well-known throughout the school for his violent behavior and troublesome attitude. When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei. Karma has been described by Karasuma as \"at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes.\" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E. It is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting. Regardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain \"vision\" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent. Despite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'. He's also shown to be hardworking when he wants to by studying diligently after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games.

{"id": "xie__lian_174773.json", "text": "<h1>Lian Xie(谢 怜)</h1><p>Birthday: July 15 Xie Lian was born to the Emperor and Empress of the nation of Xian Le. The nation was very prosperous: vast resources, beautiful arts, beautiful women, and happy citizens. The prince wanted for nothing, and was beloved throughout the kingdom. While he was a bit strange, not caring for politics or money, he was strong in his belief that he would be able to help the common people. He studied cultivation from a young age at the renowned Taoist Huang Ji Temple. It was there that he met one of his future generals, Mu Qing. Mu Qing worked as an errand boy at the temple, and only with Xie Lian's recommendation was he given the chance to study cultivation. As a child of Xianle royalty, he was known to be pampered and spoiled since young. He was kind, beloved and determined to help the common people no matter how it would affect his own status. Though firm in his goal, the issues of the mortal realm often turned out to be more complicated than expected. He pursued multiple attempts at saving his kingdom that did not serve as long-lasting solutions, often faced with the reality that his ideas were difficult to achieve and that he did not have the answer for what his nation needed. His futile efforts led him to become incessantly worried and feeling powerless. The continuous frustration and desperation he experienced caused Xie Lian to even have outbursts of anger at times. Instances of this would be him vigorously trying to kill Lang Ying or him lashing out against Human Face Disease patients.[8] His confidence and strength wavered more and more and during his kingdom's complete fall, Xie Lian spiraled into a sorrowful and helpless state. Throughout his first banishment from the Heavens, his state gradually worsened.He continued to care for Mu Qing and Feng Xin and vice versa, but the circumstances tore greatly at their relationship. When Mu Qing ultimately left, Xie Lian held no anger towards him as he doesn't like to force people, though it was only then that Xie Lian realized how much work Mu Qing did for him and his family. Soon after, Xie Lian also noticed he had never given Feng Xin any kind of honor or show of gratitude for his service. When Xie Lian does gift him a golden belt, it's partially a form of bribe as he deeply feared Feng Xin would leave him as well. The gradual decline of their situation and the return of Bai Wuxiang lead to Xie Lian's mental state worsening. This stress and desperation lead him to break his own virtues and drink alcohol, as well as try to steal, though he quickly regretted the attempt. After seeing that Feng Xin refused to give up, he also tried to work hard and cultivate again, but the attempt failed due to what transpired on the spiritual mountain. Following the one hundred swords incident, Xie Lian significantly changed. He became reserved, cold and impulsively violent. Once Feng Xin left and he found his parents had committed suicide, Xie Lian attempted to take his own life as well, desperately wishing for death. He eventually turned the built up sorrow and hatred into a revenge plan against Yong'an, burning down the palace with Wuming. Before Xie Lian spread the Human Face Disease to the common people though, he tested humanity's kindness one more time. His faith in the people was then ultimatley restored after a farmer helped him out. By the time of his third ascension, Xie Lian is a kind and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he remains down-to-earth. He never holds his status above others and treats people equally, disregarding status as a sign of one's worth. He is a compassionate man who's willing to offer his help, being indifferent towards opinions of others. Although he does not care for reputation, he still finds himself often caught in situations that make him unsure whether to laugh or cry, usually when faced with moments that cause him embarrassment or feeling awkward. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he doesn't hesitate to save those he's had conflicts with. Similarly, he is loyal to those who are kind to him and those he considers friends. Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, he can also see the best in others. He sometimes has wrong perceptions of people's personalities, but he's usually convinced of their good sides and believes the people he knows even when circumstances may say otherwise. In the direst of situations, he is still able to remain calm and think up strategies on how to defeat the enemy. However, when faced with Hua Cheng's flirtatious and romantic gestures, he becomes quite flustered. While strategically intelligent and able to see past people's lies and deceptions due to his many years of suffering and witnessing political struggles, he seems partially oblivious to romantic advances.

She is the granddaughter of Hayato Furinji and the daughter of Saiga Furinji the leaders of Ryozanpaku and Yami's One Shadow Nine Fists respectively. It is unknown how or when Miu came into Hayato's care but she has been with him since she was at least 6-years-old. It was in these early years of her life that Miu learned martial arts from her grandfather and also accompanied him on his missions to bring about peace. Before Miu transferred to Kouryou she attended a school that was apparently quite famous but didn't fit in because all the girls in the school were jealous of her looks. It is because of this that Miu attempted to moderate her appearance by fashioning her hair into a plain-looking braid and began to wear glasses. Though she kept this facade going well into her second year she eventually discarded them. Despite being attractive, athletic, kind, and humble, Miu is very socially inept to the point of having no friends before meeting Kenichi and has practically no social life. The reason for Miu's immense amount of social ineptness stems from her upbringing in which she never had any time to make friends and also from her home life in which she is practically a live-in maid. In spite of this however Miu has managed to make quite a few friends over the course of the series due to her kind and friendly nature as well as some help from Kenichi. Miu has a great fondness of kittens and becomes openly hostile towards anyone who harms one and even once tortured Kenichi because he ruined an opportunity for her to have one. Miu has consistently proven herself throughout the series to be an immensely skilled fighter.

As a junior disciple of the Lanling Jin Clan, Xue Yang views the cultivators around him with contempt and shows no fear in the presence of the intimidating Nie Mingjue. Xue Yang seems particularly sensitive to the notion that people look down on him, often reacting with killing intent. Xue Yang was a guest of the Jin Clan who recreated the destroyed half of the Stygian Tiger Seal. He was found by Xiao Xingchen and A-Qing while he was injured and unconscious on the streets. He was then brought to an uninhabited coffin house where the two tended to his injuries. As the two did not know his real identity, he used Xiao Xingchen's blindness to his advantage and ended up living with them for years through deception. However, he was exposed when A-Qing witnessed his malicious intent. He fought Xiao Xingchen and ultimately revealed the truth, which caused Xiao Xingchen to commit suicide. As Xue Yang was unable to turn him into a fierce corpse, he stored his shattered soul in a spirit-trapping pouch. He later found A-Qing who was seeking revenge, and killed her by digging her eyes and cutting her tongue out.
